MCU_NAM,More CitizenUnits
MCU_DESC,Increases the number of CitizenUnits (NOT citizens!) supported by the game.
MCU_BOOST,Increase CitizenUnit limit (base game: 524,288)
MCU_X2,Increase CitizenUnit limit to 1,048,576
MCU_BOOST_TXT1,Games saved with expanded CitizenUnit limits will NOT be reloadable without this mod. This is NOT reversible.
MCU_BOOST_TXT2,Saves with expanded CitizenUnit limits will always be loaded with the expanded limit.
MCU_FIX,Detect and fix invalid CitizenUnits on load
MCU_CLEAN,Recover from CitizenUnit array corruption
MCU_NUKE,Reset entire CitizenUnit array on next load
MCU_NUKE_TXT1,Selecting this option will rebuild your city's entire CitizenUnit array from scratch the next time you load it. This will reset all vehicle and building capacities to their current calculated value (including effects of mods such as Ploppable RICO Revisited and Realistic Population) and allocate your exisiting population to the fixed values as best as possible.
MCU_NUKE_TXT2,"This option may result in a temporary drop in city population, but will ensure that any data corruption is fixed."
MCU_NUKE_TXT3,"Try this if you are experiencing errors that could indicate a corrupted CitizenUnit array, such as buildings with 0/0 populations even when the CitizenUnit limit hasn't been reached, or buildings whose populations seem to fluctuate for no reason."
MCU_NUKE_TXT4,"This option will automatically deactivate once used, as it shouldn't need to be used more than once."
